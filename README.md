# pandora-box
A "mystery" generator

## The Groups (who)

1. The Bank Heist Crew
2. The Cult of Sacrifice
3. The Organ Thieves
4. The Drug Cartel
5. The Secret Agents
6. The Human Experiments Conspiracy
7. The Smuggling Operation
8. The Underground Street Racers
9. The Crook Cops
10. The Idiots Convention
11. The Red Comrades

* in the mission, you may, or may not, enconter a NPC related to the groups: you may enconter only a bunch of dead corpses or an abandoned facility

## The Places (where)

1. A ghost ship
2. A plane crash site
3. A building floor* -> fixed geometry
4. A building rooftop* -> fixed geometry
5. A basement* -> fixed geometry
6. A temporary camp

* can be sealed (no longer accessible) and then reutilized: once the mystery is solved, the "cleanup" team cleans the scene and seals the place (or just leave it empty), or the place seals itself (bunker); a new group can find the place, populate it and use it for other mystery
